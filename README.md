## Installation
To initialize this app, in the command line, first run ```npm init```. Next, install the following npm packages (MySQL2, Express, Sequelize) by entering ```npm install mysql2 express sequelize```. Finally, the app also uses the dotenv package. To install enter ```npm install dotenv --save-dev``` to save to your devDependencies.

Before one can utilize the routing methods, you must seed the database by running ```npm run seed``` (Be sure that add that script to your package.json file beforehand).

Once that's done, you can run the app by entering ```npm start```
